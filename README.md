EXAMPLES OF LINKED LISTS

1. Created a Singly Linked List and its methods

2. Created a Circular Linked List and its methods

3. Created a Doubly Linked List and its methods

4. Did not create unit tests at this time (wanted this to be a resource to study with)
    - hopefully will have time to come back to and make unit tests to reinforce knowledge
